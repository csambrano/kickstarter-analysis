# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to figure out how other Kickstarter campaigns went depending on the funding goals and launch dates. Pivot tables and charts are used for the analysis. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This part of the analysis was done by creating a pivot table based off the Kickstarter data. The table is filtered by “theater” as the parent category with the option to filter by specific years, months are used for the rows, and the outcomes are used for the columns. A line chart is created to visualize the data from the pivot table. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This part of the analysis was done by creating a table based off different ranges of campaign goals and the percentages of each outcome in each range. This was done by utilizing the “count ifs” formula on the Kickstarter data. Another line chart is created with the goal ranges in the x-axis and outcome percentages on the y-axis.  


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I ran into an issue with the line chart for the outcomes based on goals because I forgot to filter specifically for “plays” in my count ifs formulas. I was able to figure it out after reviewing the data again. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

If we are looking specifically at launch dates, then May through July are the best months to launch a Kickstarter campaign for the theater category. Launching a campaign in December gives you about a 50/50 chance of having a success.  


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarter goals that are below $5000 have a higher chance of being successful as well as goals in the $35000 to $44999 range. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There is no data beyond 2017 and the sample size in each goal range are very different. The sample size for Kickstarter goals below $10000 are much larger. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a table and/or graph based off backer counts or average donations.
